# About #
This project is based on a bachelor thesis which task is to create a driver for an ethernet microcontroller ENCX24J600 compatible with AVR Butterfly.

Thanks to:
  * uIP TCP/IP stack from Adam Dunkels (http://www.dunkels.com/adam/uip)
  * ENC28J60 driver by Pascal Stang
  * already existing project based on atmega168 and ENC28J60 (http://code.google.com/p/avr-uip)
  * Microchip's TCP/IP stack :)



# Driver #
If you just want to use simplified driver in your project with AVR microcontroller and ENC424J600/ENC624J600 connected with SPI bus, you can download it here (version 0.2):
  * http://files.melnikoff.org/public/projects/encx24j600/enc424j600.h
  * http://files.melnikoff.org/public/projects/encx24j600/enc424j600conf.h
  * http://files.melnikoff.org/public/projects/encx24j600/enc424j600.c
If you have any experience with the driver, I'll be happy if you let me know about it on email. :-)

Ping flood with 100% response and simple http server preview on AVR Butterfly with ethernet controller ENC424J600. Sorry for bad quality, I have only simple camcoder on my mobile phone. :)
